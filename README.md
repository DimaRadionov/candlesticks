# My Solution

I tried to implement the whole task, wrote almost everything and getting exception, that the port 5432 is used. 
I tried to fix it, but didn't help me. The task is really a challenge and I enjoyed it, thank you very much.
You can find directories as config, repositories and services, which should help with the implementation of the task.
